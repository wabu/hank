== ABOUT ==
Hank is a 2d jump and slash game. 

It is a cross-university project from the FU-Berlin and the MDH Berlin.

The students of the FU (including me) do the prgramming and the students of the
MDH do the design. 

We use java and over-software-engenier everything -- as that's what we learned in university ;)
